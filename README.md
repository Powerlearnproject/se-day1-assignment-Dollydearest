Software Engineering Day1 Assignment

#Part 1: Introduction to Software Engineering

Explain what software engineering is and discuss its importance in the technology industry.
Software Engineering is the process of designing, developing, testing and maintaining sofware in a structured way. It is importance because it ensures that sofware is reliable, effecient and meets user needs

Identify and describe at least three key milestones in the evolution of software engineering.
1950s-60s: Birth of software engineering as computers became more advanced.

1970s-80s: Introduction of structured programming and early development methodologies like Waterfall.

1990s-Present: Agile, DevOps, and cloud computing transformed how software is built and delivered.


List and briefly explain the phases of the Software Development Life Cycle.

1. Planning – Understanding the problem and setting goals.


2. Requirements Gathering – Collecting what users need.


3. Design – Creating the software blueprint.


4. Development – Writing the actual code.


5. Testing – Checking for bugs and errors.


6. Deployment – Releasing the software to users.


7. Maintenance – Updating and fixing issues over time.


Compare and contrast the Waterfall and Agile methodologies. Provide examples of scenarios where each would be appropriate.
Waterfall: A step-by-step approach where each phase is completed before moving to the next. Best for projects with clear, fixed requirements (e.g., banking systems).

Agile: A flexible, iterative approach where development happens in small cycles. Best for fast-changing projects (e.g., mobile apps).

Describe the roles and responsibilities of a Software Developer, a Quality Assurance Engineer, and a Project Manager in a software engineering team.
Software Developer: Writes and maintains code for applications.

Quality Assurance Engineer: Tests software to ensure it works correctly.

Project Manager: Plans and oversees the entire development process.


Discuss the importance of Integrated Development Environments (IDEs) and Version Control Systems (VCS) in the software development process. Give examples of each.

IDEs help developers write, test, and debug code efficiently e.g., Visual Studio Code, IntelliJ.

VCSs track code changes and help teams collaborate (e.g., Git, GitHub).

What are some common challenges faced by software engineers? Provide strategies to overcome these challenges.

Tight Deadlines → Use project management tools like Jira.

Changing Requirements → Follow Agile methods to adapt quickly.

Debugging Issues → Use testing frameworks and code reviews.

Explain the different types of testing (unit, integration, system, and acceptance) and their importance in software quality assurance.
Unit Testing: Tests individual parts of the code to catch errors early.

Integration Testing: Ensures different components work well together.

System Testing: Checks the whole software to see if it meets requirements.

Acceptance Testing: Confirms the software is ready for users.

#Part 2: Introduction to AI and Prompt Engineering

Define prompt engineering and discuss its importance in interacting with AI models.
Prompt engineering is crafting clear and specific instructions to get better responses from AI models. It helps improve accuracy and efficiency in AI interactions and ensures that we get high quality output from AI.

Provide an example of a vague prompt and then improve it by making it clear, specific, and concise. Explain why the improved prompt is more effective.
Vague Prompt: "Tell me about cars."

Improved Prompt: "Explain the history and key features of electric cars in simple terms."

Why It’s Better: The improved prompt is specific, making the AI give a more useful and detailed response.
